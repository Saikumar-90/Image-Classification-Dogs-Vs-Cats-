# Image Classification: Dogs vs Cats

## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying images as either dogs or cats using Deep Learning techniques. 
The models are implemented and trained in Google Colab using Python and popular deep learning libraries.
Both a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a transfer learning approach are used to compare performance.

## Objectives
- To build an image classification model for dogs and cats
- To understand image preprocessing and data augmentation
- To train and evaluate deep learning models
- To compare a simple CNN with a transfer learning model

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Cats vs Dogs Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- The dataset contains labeled images of dogs and cats.
- Images are resized, normalized, and augmented before training.
- The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

## Methodology / Workflow
1. Import required libraries
2. Load and preprocess the dataset
3. Apply image augmentation techniques
4. Build a CNN model
5. Train the CNN model
6. Apply transfer learning using MobileNetV2
7. Evaluate model performance
8. Test the model with sample images
